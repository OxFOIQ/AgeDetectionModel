# Age Detection AI Model 

AI model for age detection from images using deep learning techniques. The model is capable of predicting age ranges from facial images.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle containing images labeled with various age ranges.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/OxFOIQ/AgeDetectionModel.git

## Required dependencies:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

scikit-learn

Keras

## Usage
Run the AgeDetectionModel.py script to train the model:

python AgeDetectionModel.py


## Model Architecture 

The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, and dense layers. The output layer is adjusted to predict age ranges.
